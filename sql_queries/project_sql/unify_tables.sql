In this project, we would like to study trends in
frequency of particular crimes over time and in different
regions of NY. Eventually, we would also like to analyze 
what correlations we see in certain socioeconomic factors 
across different NY and the amount of crime per capita. 
In order to do so, we must combine disparate tables
so that they can be more organized and the data more
accessible.
